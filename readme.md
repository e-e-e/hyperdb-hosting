# hyperdb-hosting

This is just a crude module to help with hosting hyperdb's until [hypercored](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercored) adds support in a smarter way.


## install
```
install hyperdb-hosting -g
```

## usage 

```
Usage: hyperdb-hosting [options]

  --cwd         [folder to run in]

```
This works much like hypercored - but reads keys from a file called `.hyperdb-list`, and stores files in a folder called `hyperdb-archive`.
